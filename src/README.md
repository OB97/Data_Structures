Algorithm Library!

- I want to create a library for myself to practice implementing concepts learned in my computer science degree from data structures to machine learning algorithms.

- I think applying the theories we learn to real programs is the most efficient way to make the information stick.

- Eventually I think I could implement data visualization tools, like step-by-step searching and sorting, or animation-style visuals.

- Important aspect of this for me personally is creating good utility functions that I can re-use and update in the future, such as a csv/json/txt file reader, hopefully will save me time from re-writing the same parsers in the future.
