CS-2920 Data Structures and Algorithms

The textbook Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne surveys the  most important algorithms and 
data structures in use today. We motivate each algorithm that we address by examining its 
impact on applications to science, engineering, and industry. The textbook is organized into six chapters:

Chapter 1: Fundamentals introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. 
It also includes our programming model.
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Bag
- Union Find

Chapter 2: Sorting considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. 
It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Priority Queues (heap sort)

Chapter 3: Searching describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, redâ€“black 
trees, and hash tables.
- Binary Search Trees
- Balanced Search Trees
  - 2-3 Trees
  - Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees
- Symbol Tables
  - Hash Maps

Chapter 4: Graphs surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first 
search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.
- Undirected Graphs
  - Depth-First Search
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Connected Components

Chapter 5: Strings investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, 
tries, regular expressions, and data compression.

Chapter 6: Context highlights connections to systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications, 
operations research, and intractability.
